# Project Background

Welcome to my exploration of the data job market, with a particular focus on Data Analyst roles. This project was inspired by a personal goal: to better understand the trends, opportunities, and in-demand skills shaping the analytics profession.

The dataset used for this analysis comes from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) and includes job postings collected a few years ago. It provides valuable information on job titles, required skills, locations, and salary data though salary figures are mostly available for positions in the United States. One notable limitation is the limited availability of salary data for Czechia and Slovakia, which restricts regional comparisons.

Although the dataset is not up to date (the latest data is from around 2023), it still offers meaningful insights into broader market patterns and skill demand. This analysis serves as a strong starting point for anyone looking to understand the data analytics landscape and lays the groundwork for more targeted and current investigations in the future.

# ‚ÅâÔ∏èAreas of Exploration

1. Analyzing the top in-demand skills across the three most common data roles.

2. Tracking trends in skill demand specific to Data Analyst positions.

3. Evaluating how different skills align with salary levels, based on available data (US).

4. Highlighting high-impact skills that combine strong demand with higher earning potential (US).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Toolset Overview

To explore the Data Analyst job market in depth, I relied on a set of essential tools and technologies:

- **Python** was at the core of my analysis, helping me process data and uncover key insights. I used several powerful libraries:
  - **Pandas** ‚Äì for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib** ‚Äì to create visualizations and better understand trends.
  - **Seaborn** ‚Äì to enhance visuals with more advanced and appealing charts.

- **Jupyter Notebook** provided a convenient environment to write and run my Python code, while also documenting my thought process alongside the results.

- **Visual Studio Code** served as my main editor for writing and testing scripts outside of the notebook.

- **Git & GitHub** were essential for version control and sharing my work, making collaboration and progress tracking easy and transparent.


# üßπ Data Preparation and Cleanup

Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for exploration. This section outlines the initial steps taken to load and prepare the dataset for meaningful insights.

## Importing and Cleaning the Data

I start by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset. After that, I carry out the initial cleaning steps, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates to make sure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

```python
#importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast

#loading data
dataset = load_dataset("lukebarousse/data_jobs")
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

#data cleaning
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```

## Filtering Czechia and Slovakia-Based Roles

To focus my analysis on the Czechia and Slovakia job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_CZ = df[df['job_country']=='Czechia'].copy()
df_SK = df[df['job_country']=='Slovakia'].copy()

#replacing inconsistent values
df_CZ['job_location'] = df_CZ['job_location'].replace({'Czechia': 'Czechia Remote', 'Anywhere': 'Czechia Remote'})

df_SK['job_location'] = df_SK['job_location'].replace({'Slovakia': 'Slovakia Remote', 'Anywhere': 'Slovakia Remote'})

#concatinating the dataframes
df_CZSK = pd.concat([df_CZ, df_SK], ignore_index=True)

```

# üîç The Analysis

Each notebook in this project takes a closer look at different aspects of the data job market. Here's how I approached and explored each question step by step.


## 1. Most In-Demand Skills for Top Data Roles

To understand which skills are most valued in the data job market, I focused on the three most common roles. After identifying these roles based on job posting frequency, I extracted the top 5 skills associated with each. This helped reveal which technical abilities are most important depending on the specific role you're aiming for.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles),1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate (job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)

fig.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Postings', fontsize=15)

## 3. Evaluating how different skills align with salary levels, based on available data (US)

To uncover which roles and skills command the highest salaries, I focused on job postings from the United States and analyzed their median salaries. I began by examining salary distributions for common roles - **Data Scientist**, **Data Engineer**, and **Data Analyst** - to understand which positions tend to offer the most competitive pay.

üìò *Detailed analysis available in the notebook:* [4_Salary_Analysis](PyProject_1/4.Salary_analysis.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data 

```python

sns.boxplot(df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order = job_order)

plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Salary Distribution in United States')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.xlim(0, 600000)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](PyProject_1/images/Salary_Distribution_in_US.png)

*Salary distribution across six major data job titles in the U.S., shown as a box plot.*

#### Key Insights:

- Clear Hierarchy in Compensation: There‚Äôs a distinct upward trend in salaries with increased seniority and specialization. Senior Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer roles sit at the top of the salary spectrum, indicating that advanced expertise and leadership in data domains are highly valued.

- Wide Salary Ranges for Senior Roles: The Senior Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer positions exhibit not only high median salaries but also wide interquartile ranges (IQR) and a large number of outliers on the upper end. This suggests substantial variability in compensation, possibly influenced by factors like company size, location, and individual expertise.

- Stable and Predictable Analyst Salaries: Data Analyst and Senior Data Analyst positions show narrower distributions with fewer high-end outliers. This indicates more standardized pay across the industry for these roles, with limited spikes in compensation.

- Engineers vs Scientists: While both engineering and science roles are well-compensated, the data suggests that Data Scientists (especially at the senior level) may have a slight edge in terms of upper salary limits hinting at strong demand for advanced analytical and machine learning skills.

- Outliers Indicate High Potential: The presence of salaries beyond $400K,  even for mid-level roles like Data Scientist and Data Engineer, indicates that professionals in these positions can achieve very high earnings under certain conditions (e.g. working at top-tier tech firms or in niche areas).

- Data Analyst Entry Point: With the lowest median and overall salary range, the Data Analyst role remains the most common entry point into the data profession. However, it offers a clear growth path into more lucrative roles as skills and responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

I then narrowed the analysis to focus solely on Data Analyst roles, examining which skills are most in demand and which correlate with the highest salaries. To present these insights clearly, I created two separate bar charts.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here‚Äôs a look at the top-paying and most in-demand skills for Data Analysts in the U.S.:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](PyProject_1/images/Highest_Paid&Most_in-demand_Skills_DA_US.png)

### Visualizing Different Techonologies

Let‚Äôs also visualize the different types of technologies in the graph by adding color labels based on their category (e.g., Programming: Python).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
