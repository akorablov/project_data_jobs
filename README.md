# Project Background

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focused on Data Analyst roles. This project was driven by a personal goal to better understand job trends and skill demand in the analytics field. One limitation of the dataset is the limited availability of salary information in Czechia and Slovakia. This may be influenced by cultural factors in the region, where salary discussions are generally considered private and not commonly shared in the workplace.

The dataset, provided through [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python), contains job postings from a few years ago, including information on job titles, salaries for US, locations, and required skills. While the data is not current (2023), the analysis still offers valuable insights into market dynamics and helps build a strong foundation for future exploration.

# ‚ÅâÔ∏èAreas of Exploration

1. Analyzing the top in-demand skills across the three most common data roles.

2. Tracking trends in skill demand specific to Data Analyst positions.

3. Evaluating how different skills align with salary levels, based on available data (US).

4. Highlighting high-impact skills that combine strong demand with higher earning potential (US).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Toolset Overview

To explore the Data Analyst job market in depth, I relied on a set of essential tools and technologies:

- **Python** was at the core of my analysis, helping me process data and uncover key insights. I used several powerful libraries:
  - **Pandas** ‚Äì for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib** ‚Äì to create visualizations and better understand trends.
  - **Seaborn** ‚Äì to enhance visuals with more advanced and appealing charts.

- **Jupyter Notebook** provided a convenient environment to write and run my Python code, while also documenting my thought process alongside the results.

- **Visual Studio Code** served as my main editor for writing and testing scripts outside of the notebook.

- **Git & GitHub** were essential for version control and sharing my work, making collaboration and progress tracking easy and transparent.


# üßπ Data Preparation and Cleanup

Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for exploration. This section outlines the initial steps taken to load and prepare the dataset for meaningful insights.

## Importing and Cleaning the Data

I start by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset. After that, I carry out the initial cleaning steps‚Äîhandling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates‚Äîto make sure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

```python
#importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast

#loading data
dataset = load_dataset("lukebarousse/data_jobs")
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

#data cleaning
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```

## Filtering Czechia and Slovakia-Based Roles

To focus my analysis on the Czechia and Slovakia job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_CZ = df[df['job_country']=='Czechia'].copy()
df_SK = df[df['job_country']=='Slovakia'].copy()

#replacing inconsistent values
df_CZ['job_location'] = df_CZ['job_location'].replace({'Czechia': 'Czechia Remote', 'Anywhere': 'Czechia Remote'})

df_SK['job_location'] = df_SK['job_location'].replace({'Slovakia': 'Slovakia Remote', 'Anywhere': 'Slovakia Remote'})

#concatinating the dataframes
df_CZSK = pd.concat([df_CZ, df_SK], ignore_index=True)

```

# üîç The Analysis

Each notebook in this project takes a closer look at different aspects of the data job market. Here's how I approached and explored each question step by step.


## 1. Most In-Demand Skills for Top Data Roles

To understand which skills are most valued in the data job market, I focused on the three most common roles. After identifying these roles based on job posting frequency, I extracted the top 5 skills associated with each. This helped reveal which technical abilities are most important depending on the specific role you're aiming for.

üìò *Detailed analysis available in the notebook:* [4_Salary_Analysis](PyProject_1/4.Salary_analysis.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data 

```python

sns.boxplot(df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order = job_order)

plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Salary Distribution in United States')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.xlim(0, 600000)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](PyProject_1/images/Salary_Distribution_in_US.png)

*Salary distribution across six major data job titles in the U.S., shown as a box plot.*

#### Key Insights:

- Clear Hierarchy in Compensation: There‚Äôs a distinct upward trend in salaries with increased seniority and specialization. Senior Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer roles sit at the top of the salary spectrum, indicating that advanced expertise and leadership in data domains are highly valued.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

I then narrowed my analysis to focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles. Specifically, I explored which skills are most in demand and which are associated with the highest salaries. To illustrate these insights, I used two separate bar charts.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Below is an overview of the top-paying and most sought-after skills for Data Analysts in the U.S.:
